# morse-code 
Maps Morse Code to English, whether dots and dashes, bits, or fuzzy bits.

This project was completed for the CodeWars [Decode the Morse code, for real](https://www.codewars.com/kata/decode-the-morse-code-for-real/) series.

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
